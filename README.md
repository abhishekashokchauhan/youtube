# Building YouTube

- What we would be building / Functional requirements ?

  - Website clone of YouTube, where you can watch the movies.
  - On home page, we can show the popular videos
  - On Left side, we can have a panel.
  - Clicking on a video, would play the video and would hide the sidebar.
  - Implemented the search with debouncing
  - Stored the search data in the redux store, to prevent making API calls for existing search.
  - Made the nested "n" level comments.
  - Hosted on the firebase.
  - Added the live chat, saved the chats on the redux store!

- What tech stack we would be using ?

  - React for the frontend
  - We would use CRA so we don't have to bootstrap things.
  - Webpack as bundler
  - Tailwind as CSS
  - Jest, Cypress as UI testing library.
